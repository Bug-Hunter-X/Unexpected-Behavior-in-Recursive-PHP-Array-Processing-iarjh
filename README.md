# PHP Recursive Array Processing Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a PHP function designed to recursively process an array. The function converts string values to lowercase, trims whitespace, and handles nested arrays. However, unexpected behavior might occur under certain conditions, particularly due to how string manipulation and recursion interact.

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The original code can lead to issues such as infinite recursion or unexpected modifications to the input array if not carefully designed. The core problem lies in how the recursive call handles potential errors and edge cases within nested arrays.  The solution addresses this by carefully considering data types and edge cases during the recursive processing.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter.  Observe the output.
3. Compare the output to the expected behavior.
4. Run `bugSolution.php` to see the corrected output.
